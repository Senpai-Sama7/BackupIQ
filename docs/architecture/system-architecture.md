# System Architecture

## Overview

The Intelligent Backup Enterprise System is designed as a microservices-based, cloud-native solution that provides semantic file organization, enterprise-grade reliability, and comprehensive observability.

## Architecture Principles

### SOLID Design Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose
- **Open/Closed**: Extensible through interfaces, stable in core functionality
- **Liskov Substitution**: All implementations are interchangeable
- **Interface Segregation**: Clients depend only on methods they use
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### Enterprise Patterns
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevents cascade failures in distributed systems
- **Retry with Exponential Backoff**: Handles transient failures gracefully
- **Bulkhead**: Isolates critical resources to prevent resource exhaustion
- **Health Check**: Provides system status for monitoring and load balancing
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-based configuration with validation

## Reliability Patterns

### Circuit Breaker Implementation

```python
@dataclass
class CircuitBreakerState:
    failures: int = 0
    last_failure_time: float = 0
    state: str = "CLOSED"  # CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN

class CircuitBreaker:
    def __init__(self, failure_threshold: int = 5, timeout: int = 60):
        self.failure_threshold = failure_threshold
        self.timeout = timeout
        self.state = CircuitBreakerState()

    async def call(self, func, *args, **kwargs):
        if self.state.state == "OPEN":
            if time.time() - self.state.last_failure_time > self.timeout:
                self.state.state = "HALF_OPEN"
            else:
                raise CircuitBreakerOpenError()

        try:
            result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
            if self.state.state == "HALF_OPEN":
                self.state.state = "CLOSED"
                self.state.failures = 0
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            self.state.failures += 1
            self.state.last_failure_time = time.time()

            if self.state.failures >= self.failure_threshold:
                self.state.state = "OPEN"

            raise e
```

### Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff

```python
async def retry_with_backoff(
    func,
    max_attempts: int = 3,
    base_delay: float = 1.0,
    max_delay: float = 60.0,
    backoff_factor: float = 2.0
):
    last_exception = None

    for attempt in range(max_attempts):
        try:
            return await func()
        except Exception as e:
            last_exception = e

            if attempt < max_attempts - 1:
                delay = min(base_delay * (backoff_factor ** attempt), max_delay)
                jitter = random.uniform(0, delay * 0.1)
                await asyncio.sleep(delay + jitter)

    raise last_exception
```

## Monitoring and Observability

### Metrics Collection

**System Metrics**:
- CPU usage, memory consumption, disk I/O
- Network throughput and latency
- Error rates and response times

**Business Metrics**:
- Files processed per minute
- Backup completion rates
- Storage utilization by provider
- Semantic classification accuracy

**Custom Metrics**:
```python
# Prometheus metrics
backup_files_processed = Counter(
    'backup_files_processed_total',
    'Total files processed',
    ['status', 'file_type']
)

backup_duration = Histogram(
    'backup_operation_duration_seconds',
    'Backup operation duration'
)

system_resource_usage = Gauge(
    'system_resource_usage_percent',
    'System resource usage',
    ['resource_type']
)
```

### Health Checks

**Endpoint**: `GET /health`

**Response**:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-24T10:30:00Z",
  "uptime_seconds": 3600,
  "checks": {
    "database": {"status": "passing", "last_check": "2025-01-24T10:29:45Z"},
    "storage": {"status": "passing", "last_check": "2025-01-24T10:29:50Z"},
    "memory": {"status": "passing", "last_check": "2025-01-24T10:30:00Z"}
  }
}
```

### Structured Logging

**Format**: JSON with correlation IDs

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-24T10:30:00Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "service": "backup-orchestrator",
  "correlation_id": "corr-abc123",

  "metadata": {
    "files_count": 150,
    "duration_ms": 5000,
    "provider": "icloud"
  }
